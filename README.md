# IP Address Allow List Management

## Description
Developed a Python algorithm to automate the management of IP address allow lists, ensuring secure access to restricted content.

## Tools Used
- Python file handling (`with open`, `.read()`, `.write()`)
- Python list methods (`.remove()`)

## Actions
- Created a script to read, update, and write IP addresses to an allow list file.
- Implemented a process to remove unauthorized IP addresses from the allow list.
- Utilized file handling techniques to manage file operations efficiently.

## Outcome
Streamlined the process of managing IP address access, improving security and reducing manual effort.
